Welcome to the GamaMath page!  

## What is GamaMath?

GamaMath is a program that can create graph of functions. There are three modes of
operation:    

```  
mode 0 - create a graph of the type f(x) = ax+b
mode 1 - create a graph of the type f(x) = ax^2+bx+c
mode 2 - create a graph of the type f(x) = ax^3+bx^2+cx+d
```  

## How to use  

You can choose 3 modes of operation. After that, you can type the coefficients of the function and then
press the "render" button to render the function.
